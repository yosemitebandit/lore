Local Legends.

### how this might work
We ask businesses to tell us about someone who is, in their eye, 'local legend.'
We find that person.
Interview them.
Take a nice picture.
Write up a few sentences about them.
We print and frame the picture and then give it to the business to hang up somewhere.
We duplicate the info online.
Maybe there's a twilio component where you call a number and hear the interview.


### also
Maybe this is expanded to include folklore.
Maybe the frame has an arduino and a wave shield to actually play the audio.
Maybe we get some more inspiration from Studs Terkel.
